Files Description
Bistable_UMAT_multi_Hetv_Mon_I1_dT_PS.for
Fortran UMAT for the constitutive response of periodic rotating bistable auxetic surfaces regularized with a gradient-enhanced first invariant of the logarithmic strain and an artificial material rate-dependency.

UC_Umat_Plane_Stress.inp
Abaqus input file for uniaxial loading of the unit-cell under periodic boundary conditions used for calibration of the constitutive response.

Strip_Mesh3_with_Phase_Field.inp
Abaqus input file for the uniaxial loading of the strip specimen. This simulation produces the stress–strain response and the transition propagation results presented in Section 3.1.
